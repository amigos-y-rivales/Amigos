//               <li>4: consider the following ideas to put in your bio to make hosts more likely to reach out to you: put two truths and a lie in there; list a song that describes your life; list the pros and cons about your life in a fun way; share some unpopular opinions; talk about your VERY favorite things</li>

//               <li>1: be safe, especially as a female. if it's a public place, use your best judgement. if it's someone's home or a secluded area, wait for another person to arrive or plan to attend with a friend or have a friend accompany you.</li>
//               <br /> 
//               <li>2: be yourself, but be your best self. please practice good manners and hygiene.</li>
//               <br />
//               <li>3: please rate the event afterwards. this helps us and other members know more about the kinds of events the host creates.</li>

//               <h1>creating events</h1>
//               <br />
//               <li>1: please take the time to think about the event before creating it. a well-thought-out well-attended event is better than a poorly-thought-out cancelled-due-to-low-sign-up event.</li>
//               <br /> 
//               <li>2: include as many details as possible. it can be annoying to have to answer a lot of messages when you could have avoided that by creating a more thorough listing.</li>
//               <br />
//               <li>2: title: introduce event and encourage others to come.</li>
//               <br />
//               <li>2: the photo: give participants a feel for what to expect and make sure it's appropriate (or we'll ban you:).</li>
//               <br />
//               <li>2: cost: if you're expecting participants to contribute, you need to specify the amount and how you'd like to receive it (e.g. Venmo, cash, check, PayPal, gold bars, ivory).</li>
//               <br />
